		<description>The Vexi are a species known for their semi-retractable claws, which are believed to have been created through splicing together the genomes of various other species, including insectoids.
      Their wrists are highly specialized, featuring reinforced tarsal bones that closely resemble human hands. These claws can be extended voluntarily for grooming or expressive purposes, but in high stress
      situations they will automatically extend and become lethal weapons. This splicing process has never been successfully replicated.</description>
