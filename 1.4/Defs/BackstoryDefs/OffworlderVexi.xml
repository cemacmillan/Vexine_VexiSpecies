        <title>Athall Native Hunter</title>
        <titleShort>hunter</titleShort>
        <baseDesc>[PAWN_nameDef] was born and raised on the frigid planet Athall, where [PAWN_pronoun] learned to survive by hunting the dangerous wildlife that roamed the icy landscape. Surrounded by an unforgiving environment and armed with advanced hunting tools passed down through generations, [PAWN_pronoun] became a skilled hunter, adept at navigating both the frozen tundras and the sparse boreal forests near the equator.
            As Athall transformed into a resort planet for those seeking snowy adventures, [PAWN_nameDef]'s way of life began to change. Eventually, [PAWN_pronoun] was swept up in the influx of offworld visitors and found [PAWN_objective]self transported to a completely new environment, with only [PAWN_possessive] hunting skills and knowledge of Athall's harsh wilderness to help [PAWN_objective] adapt.</baseDesc>
