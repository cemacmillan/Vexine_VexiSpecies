  <description>[img][/img]Vexi are a vulpecular, fur-covered species of uncertain origin, adapted to many of the same niches as humans. A lonely engineer, stranded on a tundra planet when improbably, his wished for someone to talk to other than
    leftover Archotech gene-splicer. Having found some interesting remains (vol. VII "Vexilogical Writings and Collected Folklore") they unextincted an unknown bipedal and fox-like species (ibid "Ancestor") (see my "Crypto Genes Expressed in Common Fox
    Species?"). The tale, said to be from the journal of cast-away engineer PF, continues: The console is unrelenting. It begs, it threatens to never speak to me again. It tries to annoy me through silence. It says: Johnson-Tanaka drives just don't fail
    randomly leaving people to fall out of the sky in survival pods onto planets and find food, material and a friendly AI! This isn't chance! It's insane, it tells me: [list] [*]Johnson-Tanaka drives just don't fail randomly. [*]People don't just fall
    out of the sky in drop pods onto planets and find food and materials and what they need to survive! [*]And find a friendly AI who wants to help them make friends. [/list] It could be true, any of that. But I think it's trying to make an army for
    itself, I know it is." These events, supposedly took place on Siproprollon IV, and here the Vexi narrative concurs for once with that of various other Off-Rim parties who claim the rights to the xenotype gt-223x9x541-fox which supposedly is that of
    the Vexi. The named world has been an iceball for at least a millenium, which ensures that this mystery will not be solved through archeology."
